# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the "contador-estoque-rapido" (Fast Inventory Counter) project for Trufas de Ouro, a Brazilian client project under AscensionTech. This appears to be a new/empty project directory that has been initialized for development.

## Current Status

The repository is currently empty except for Claude Code configuration files. This suggests the project is in its initial setup phase and ready for development to begin.

## Development Setup

Since this is a new project, the development environment and build system have not yet been established. When setting up the project, consider:

- Determining the technology stack (web app, mobile app, desktop app, etc.)
- Setting up appropriate package management (npm/yarn for Node.js, pip for Python, etc.)
- Establishing build and development scripts
- Setting up testing frameworks
- Configuring linting and code formatting tools

## Project Context

- **Client**: Trufas de Ouro (Gold Truffles)
- **Company**: AscensionTech
- **Purpose**: Fast inventory counting system
- **Location**: Brazilian client project

## Next Steps for Development

When beginning development on this project:

1. Establish the technology stack and framework
2. Initialize the appropriate package management system
3. Set up development, build, and test commands
4. Configure code quality tools (linting, formatting)
5. Update this CLAUDE.md file with specific commands and architecture details

## Configuration

The project has Claude Code permissions configured to allow:
- `Bash(find:*)` - File system searching
- `Bash(ls:*)` - Directory listing
